        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This is the privacy policy for the "die" discord bot.</p>
        <h2>Nothing is logged</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing is logged in the console. This is just a bot made for fun,
            why would I do that
        </p>
        <h2>I was forced to write this</h2>
        <p>Discord wants me to write this to get the bot verified. So uh</p>
        <h2>Types of data that's stored</h2>
        <p>
            The only data that's stored are
            <strong>your defined words</strong> (legacy feature that was
            removed) and <strong>user ID</strong> (if you've been interacted
            with through one of the bot's roleplay commands). There's nothing
            else. It's just the bare minimum required for the bot.
        </p>
        <h2>There's like nothing else</h2>
        <p>
            I'll keep this short and sweet. I won't make it excessively long. I
            won't put complex language here. That's all there is to the bot. I
            don't track you or whatever.
        </p>
